# ðŸŒŸ Real-World DPK Examples

Welcome to our showcase of real-world FaaS applications! Let's explore how Dataloop's serverless functions are being used in production environments. These examples are drawn from our [public apps repository](https://github.com/dataloop-ai-apps) and demonstrate the power and flexibility of FaaS.

## ðŸ¤– AI Model Integration Examples

### ResNet Model Integration
The [torch-models](https://github.com/dataloop-ai-apps/torch-models/) repository provides ready-to-use model adapters for popular PyTorch architectures. The ResNet-50 adapter is perfect for image classification tasks and can be easily fine-tuned on your custom datasets. To use it:
1. Install the torch-models app from the Dataloop Marketplace
2. Get the installed model:
```python
# list the models in the project
models = project.models.list().print()

# get the model
model = project.models.get('-model-name')
```

2. Fine-tune on your dataset by connecting it to the model and initiating training.

### Faster R-CNN Object Detection
The [fasterrcnn-adapter](https://github.com/dataloop-ai-apps/fasterrcnn-adapter) provides a production-ready implementation of the Faster R-CNN model for object detection. Key features include:
- Pre-trained model support
- Custom training configuration
- Polygon annotation support
- Batch prediction capabilities
- GPU acceleration

The adapter is particularly useful for:
- Object detection in complex scenes
- Transfer learning on custom datasets
- Real-time inference applications

### CLIP Model Integration
From our [clip-model-adapter](https://github.com/dataloop-ai-apps/clip-model-adapter), here's how to implement zero-shot image classification:

```python
import torch
from PIL import Image
import dtlpy as dl
from transformers import CLIPProcessor, CLIPModel

class ServiceRunner(dl.BaseServiceRunner):
    def __init__(self):
        self.device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
        self.model = CLIPModel.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
        self.processor = CLIPProcessor.from_pretrained("openai/clip-vit-base-patch32")
        self.model.to(self.device)
    
    def classify_item(self, item: dl.Item, candidate_labels: list):
        # Download and process image
        image = Image.open(item.download(save_locally=False))
        inputs = self.processor(
            images=image,
            text=candidate_labels,
            return_tensors="pt",
            padding=True
        ).to(self.device)
        
        # Get prediction
        outputs = self.model(**inputs)
        probs = outputs.logits_per_image.softmax(dim=1)
        
        # Add classification
        builder = item.annotations.builder()
        builder.add(
            annotation_definition=dl.Classification(
                label=candidate_labels[probs.argmax().item()],
                confidence=float(probs.max().item())
            )
        )
        item.annotations.upload(builder)
```

## ðŸ”„ Integration Examples

### GCS Export Service
Based on [export-gcs](https://github.com/dataloop-ai-apps/export-gcs), here's how to export annotations to Google Cloud Storage:

```python
import dtlpy as dl
from google.cloud import storage

class ServiceRunner(dl.BaseServiceRunner):
    def __init__(self):
        self.client = storage.Client()
    
    def export_annotations(self, dataset: dl.Dataset, bucket_name: str):
        # Get bucket
        bucket = self.client.get_bucket(bucket_name)
        
        # Export annotations for each item
        for item in dataset.items.list():
            # Get annotations
            annotations = item.annotations.list()
            
            # Convert to desired format
            export_data = self._format_annotations(annotations)
            
            # Upload to GCS
            blob = bucket.blob(f"annotations/{item.id}.json")
            blob.upload_from_string(
                data=json.dumps(export_data),
                content_type='application/json'
            )
    
    def _format_annotations(self, annotations):
        # Implement annotation formatting logic
        pass
```
