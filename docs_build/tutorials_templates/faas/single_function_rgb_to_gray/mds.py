    # Basic Use Case: Single Function
    ## Create and Deploy a Sample Function
    Below is an image-manipulation function in Python to use for converting an RGB image to a grayscale image. The function receives a single item, which later can be used as a trigger to invoke the function:

    You can now deploy the function as a service using Dataloop SDK. Once the service is ready, you may execute the available function on any input:

def func3():

    ## Execute the function
    An execution means running the function on a service with specific inputs (arguments). The execution input will be provided to the function that the execution runs.

    Now that the service is up, it can be executed manually (on-demand) or automatically, based on a set trigger (time/event). As part of this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to manually run the “RGB to Gray” function. 

    To see the item we uploaded, run the following code:

    Let’s convert the item from RGB to grayscale, using the service we created:

    The transformed image will be saved in your dataset in the folder specified. 
	You may now open the item received upon execution:
