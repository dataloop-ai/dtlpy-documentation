    ### Filter Operators
    To understand more about filter operators please click <a href="https://docs.dataloop.ai/docs/dql-operators" target="_blank">here</a>.

    When adding a filter, several operators are available for use:

    #### Equal
    eq -> equal
    (or dl.FiltersOperation.EQUAL)

    For example, filter items from a specific folder directory.
    """


def section2():
    """
    #### Not Equal
    ne -> not equal
    (or dl.FiltersOperation.NOT_EQUAL)

    In this example, you will get all items that do not have ONLY a 'cat' label.
    **Note**
    This Operator is a better fit for filters of a single value because, for example, this filter will return items that have both 'cat' and 'dog' labels.
    View an example of the solution [here](#how-to-filter-items-that-dont-have-a-specific-label).
    """


def section3():
    """
    #### Greater Than
    gt -> greater than
    (or dl.FiltersOperation.GREATER_THAN)

    You will get items with a greater height (in pixels) than the given value in this example.
    """


def section4():
    """
    #### Less Than
    lt -> less than
    (or dl.FiltersOperation.LESS_THAN)

    You will get items with a width (in pixels) less than the given value in this example.
    """


def section5():
    """
    #### In a List
    in -> is in a list (when using this expression, values should be a list).
    (or dl.FiltersOperation.IN)
    In this example, you will get items with dog OR cat labels.

    Filters ignore SDK defaults like hidden items and directories or note annotations as issues.

    #### How to filter items that were created between specific dates?
    Note that all the times in Dataloop's data bases are stored in UTC time, so when filtering by a relative time to your time zone, you'll need to adjust it to the UTC time.
    Here are two examples:
