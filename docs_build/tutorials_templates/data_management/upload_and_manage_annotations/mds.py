    Uploading annotations to video items needs to consider spanning between frames, and toggling visibility (occlusion). In this example, we will use the following CSV file.
    In this file there is a single 'person' box annotation that begins on frame number 20, disappears on frame number 41, reappears on frame number 51 and ends on frame number 90.

    ## Download Data, Annotations & Metadata
    The item ID for a specific file can be found in the platform UI - Click BROWSE for a dataset, click on the selected file, and the file information will be displayed in the right-side panel. The item ID is detailed, and can be copied in a single click.

    ## Download Items and Annotations
    Download dataset items and annotations to your computer folder in two separate folders.
    To list the download annotation option use `dl.ViewAnnotationOptions`:
    1. JSON: Download json files with the Dataloop annotation format.
    2. MASK: Save a PNG image file with the RGB annotation drawn.
    3. INSTANCE: Saves a PNG with the annotation label ID as the pixel value.
    4. ANNOTATION_ON_IMAGE: Saves a PNG with the annotation drawn on top of the image.
    5. VTT: Save `subtitle` annotation type in a VTT format.
    6. OBJECT_ID: Save a PNG with the object ID as the pixel value.

    Files can be exported from a dataset with their file extension as part of the exported filename. The export_version param in dataset.download can be set to ExportVersion.V1 or ExportVersion.V2 to avoid duplication of files with different extensions. This allows items with the same filename and different extensions in the dataset to be saved as different items.
