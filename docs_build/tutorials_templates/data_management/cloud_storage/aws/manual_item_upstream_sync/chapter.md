## Dataset Manual item upstream sync  
  
In a case you want to upload specific item from your bucket and you don't want to use automatic upstream sync  

```python
import dtlpy as dl
dl.login()
# This path is in AWS context
# In a case the item is located in a folder add the folder name as well "folder/item.png"
item_path = 'external://' + '<Your_item_full_name>'
# If you want to upload items to specific folder in Dataloop, you can specify the folder path
remote_path = '/Test_Folder'
dataset = dl.datasets.get(dataset_id='your dataset id')
dataset.items.upload(local_path=item_path, remote_path=remote_path)
```
