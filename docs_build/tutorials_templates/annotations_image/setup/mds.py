    ## Initiation
    Using the annotation definitions classes you can create, edit, view and upload platform annotations. Each annotation init receives the coordinates for the specific type, label, and optional attributes.

    ## Optional Plotting
    Before updating items with annotations, you can optionally plot the annotation you created and review it before uploading it. This applies to all annotations described in the following section.
