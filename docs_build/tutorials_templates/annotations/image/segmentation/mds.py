    Each annotation init receives the coordinates for the specific type, label, and optional attributes. A binary mask should be exactly the same dimensions as the image item, with 0 for background and 1 for the annotation.

    The following script convert all the polygon annotations to segmentation annotations, merge them into one mask per

    1. All previous polygon and segmentation annotations will be deleted, and the new merged segmentation annotations

    2. All the polygon and segmentation annotations attributes will be deleted.
