# Understanding Model Adapters: The Magic Behind the Scenes

Ever wondered how Dell Data Orchestration Engine (DDOE) seamlessly integrates with your ML models? Let's peek behind the curtain and explore the Model Adapter's inner workings! 

## The Two Types of Functions

Think of the Model Adapter as a theater production with two types of actors:

1. **Wrapper Functions** - The stage managers who handle all the behind-the-scenes work
   - Part of the `BaseModelAdapter` class
   - Handle data movement, file management, and coordination
   - Make your life easier by managing the complex stuff

2. **User Functions** - The star performers you get to direct
   - Functions you implement in your `ModelAdapter`
   - Contain your model's specific logic
   - Turn your ML model into a DDOE-ready superstar

Let's meet our cast of characters!

## The Stage Managers: Wrapper Functions

### `load_from_model`: The Setup Crew

![image](../../../../assets/images/model_management/flows/load_from_model.png)

What happens:
1. Downloads your model's artifacts
2. Creates a cozy home at `~/.dataloop/models/{model.name}`
3. Calls your `load` function to bring the model to life

Your files will be organized like this:
```
DATALOOP_PATH/
└── models/
    └── model.name/
        └── artifacts/
```

### `save_to_model`: The Preservation Expert

What happens:
1. Calls your `save` function to package up the model
2. Uploads everything to DDOE's cloud
3. Keeps your model safe and sound

### `predict_items`: The Performance Director

The show must go on! Here's how:
1. Creates batches of items
2. Prepares each batch using your `prepare_item_func`
3. Makes predictions using your `predict` function
4. Saves the results as annotations
5. Repeats until all items are processed

### `train_model`: The Training Coach

Your model's training journey:
1. Loads the current model state
2. Prepares training data
3. Trains using your `train` function
4. Saves the improved model
5. Cleans up temporary files

Your training data will be organized like this:
```
DATALOOP_PATH/
└── models/
    └── model.name/
        └── artifacts/
└── model_data/
    └── model.id_model.name/
        └── timestamp/
            ├── output/
            └── datasets/
                └── dataset.id/
                    ├── train/
                    │   ├── items/
                    │   └── json/
                    └── validation/
                        ├── items/
                        └── json/
```

### `evaluate_model`: The Performance Reviewer

How your model gets its report card:
1. Loads the latest model version
2. Makes predictions on test data
3. Compares with ground truth
4. Generates performance metrics

### `embed_items`: The Feature Vector Transformer

![image](../../../../assets/images/model_management/flows/embed_items.png)

The embedding process:
1. Creates batches of items
2. Prepares each batch using your `prepare_item_func`
3. Generates embeddings using your `embed` function
4. Stores the vectors in a feature set
5. Repeats until all items are processed


## Your Star Performers: User Functions

### Required Functions for Different Use Cases:

#### For Prediction Only:
- `load` - Brings your model to life
- `predict` - Makes predictions on data

#### For Training:
- Everything above, plus:
- `train` - Teaches your model new tricks
- `save` - Preserves your model's knowledge

#### For Embedding:
- `load` - Brings your model to life
- `embed` - Converts items to feature vectors
- `prepare_item_func` - Prepares items for embedding

### Function Details

#### `load`
```python
def load(self, local_path, **kwargs):
    """Load your model from files"""
    self.model = YourModel.load(local_path)
```

#### `save`
```python
def save(self, local_path, **kwargs):
    """Save your model's state"""
    torch.save(self.model.state_dict(), f'{local_path}/weights.pth')
```

#### `train`
```python
def train(self, data_path, **kwargs):
    """Train your model on new data"""
    # Your training logic here
    pass
```

#### `predict`
```python
def predict(self, batch, **kwargs):
    """Make predictions and return DDOE annotations"""
    predictions = self.model(batch)
    return convert_to_annotations(predictions)
```

#### `prepare_item_func`
```python
def prepare_item_func(self, item):
    """Prepare items for prediction"""
    return preprocess_for_model(item)
```

#### `embed`
```python
def embed(self, batch, **kwargs):
    """Convert a batch of items into embedding vectors"""
    embeddings = self.model.encode(item)
    return embeddings
```

## Pro Tips for Model Adapter Success

1. **Error Handling**
   - Add proper logging in each function
   - Handle edge cases gracefully
   - Validate inputs and outputs

2. **Performance**
   - Optimize batch processing
   - Use efficient data loading
   - Clean up temporary files

3. **Best Practices**
   - Document your functions clearly
   - Follow the function signatures
   - Test each component thoroughly
