    "# Dataloop AI Advanced Embedding Processing Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a comprehensive guide and a ready-to-use workflow for enhancing your datasets with advanced embedding techniques. By leveraging your existing data labels, you can generate more powerful and insightful data representations for visualization and similarity search.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workflow Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide will walk you through the following key stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **[Setup and Configuration](#setup):** Installing dependencies and establishing a connection to the Dataloop platform. This section runs a fully automated setup to create a project and dataset for this tutorial.\n",
    "2. **[Option A: Label-Guided UMAP Embedding](#option-a):** A powerful technique for creating 3D embeddings that are visually clustered based on your data's labels. Ideal for data exploration and pattern discovery.\n",
    "3. **[Option B: Extended CLIP Embedding](#option-b):** A method to enrich existing CLIP feature vectors by appending binary information derived from your labels, significantly improving similarity search performance.\n",
    "4. **[Conclusion and Next Steps](#conclusion):** A summary of what you've accomplished and how to leverage your new, enhanced embeddings in the Dataloop platform.\n",

    "#### Option A: Label-Guided UMAP Embedding\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Creates low-dimensional (3D) embeddings that visually group items with similar labels.\n",
    "- **Best for**: Interactive visualization, understanding data structure, and discovering how labels relate to underlying features.\n",
    "- **Output**: A new Dataloop feature set with 3D coordinates, viewable in the platform's 3D data viewer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option B: Extended CLIP Embedding  \n",
    "- **Purpose**: Augments high-dimensional CLIP features with explicit label data.\n",
    "- **Best for**: Powering more accurate similarity searches where both visual and label information are important.\n",
    "- **Output**: A new Dataloop feature set with enriched, high-dimensional vectors."

The result is an embedding where items with similar labels are positioned closer together in the 3D space.\n",

    "1. **Input**: Takes the existing high-dimensional feature vectors (e.g., from CLIP) and the corresponding annotation labels for each item.\n",

    "## 3. Option B: Extended CLIP Embedding\n",
    "\n",
    "**Choose this option if your goal is to improve similarity search performance.** This technique enriches your existing high-dimensional CLIP vectors by appending binary information derived from your labels. This allows similarity searches to consider both visual features and explicit label data, leading to more accurate results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it Works:\n",
    "1. **Input**: Takes the existing high-dimensional CLIP feature vectors and the annotation labels for each item.\n",
    "2. **Process**: First, all unique labels across the dataset are identified. For each item, a binary vector is created where each position corresponds to a unique label (1 if present, 0 if absent). This binary vector is then concatenated to the end of the item's original CLIP vector.\n",
    "3. **Output**: A new, higher-dimensional feature vector for each item.\n",
    "4. **Result**: A new Dataloop feature set containing these extended embeddings, ready to be used for enhanced similarity search.\n",
    "\n",
    "**💡 Example**: If your original CLIP features are 512-dimensional and you have 10 unique labels in your dataset, the new extended features will be 522-dimensional (512 + 10)."

    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You have successfully walked through the process of enhancing a dataset with advanced, label-aware embedding techniques. You have created one or two new feature sets in your Dataloop project, each tailored for a specific purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of Results\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you chose Option A (Label-Guided UMAP):**\n",
    "- You created a `3d` feature set (e.g., `umap-label-enhanced`).\n",
    "- These embeddings are optimized for visualization, where items with similar labels are clustered together.\n",
    "- **Next Step:** Navigate to the dataset in the Dataloop platform, go to the 'Embeddings' tab, select your new 3D feature set, and explore your data in the interactive 3D viewer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you chose Option B (Extended CLIP):**\n",
    "- You created a high-dimensional `embedding` feature set (e.g., `extended-clip`).\n",
    "- These embeddings are enriched with label information, making them ideal for more accurate similarity searches.\n",
    "- **Next Step:** Use the platform's similarity search feature (e.g., by right-clicking an item and selecting 'Find Similar'). Ensure you select your new extended feature set to power the search.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Further Actions\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Downstream Tasks:** These new feature sets can be used as inputs for other machine learning models or pipelines.\n",
    "*   **Parameter Tuning:** Experiment with the parameters in the UMAP and Extended CLIP generation cells to see how they affect your results.\n",
    "*   **Automation:** Integrate this notebook's logic into a Dataloop FaaS (Function as a Service) to automatically generate enhanced embeddings whenever your dataset is updated."
