       "# Comprehensive Video Annotation with Generative AI\n",
       "\n",
       "This notebook provides a detailed walkthrough of an advanced, automated video annotation system. It leverages powerful Generative AI models (like Gemini) through the Dataloop platform to process and analyze videos of home activities, generating high-quality, structured annotations.\n",

       "\n",
       "This guide will walk you through the following key stages:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **[Environment Setup](#environment-setup):** Installing dependencies and connecting to your Dataloop environment.\n",
       "2. **[Project, Model, and Dataset Setup](#project-setup):** Configuring your Dataloop project, dataset, and the GenAI model for the annotation task.\n",
       "3. **[VideoAnnotations Class Definition](#class-definition):** Exploring the comprehensive Python class that encapsulates the entire video processing logic.\n",
       "4. **[Initialize Video Processor](#initialize-processor):** Creating an instance of the processor to run on our data.\n",
       "5. **[Test Single Video Processing](#test-single-video):** Performing a dry run on a single video to verify the setup.\n",
       "6. **[Process Test Video](#process-single-video):** Executing the full, comprehensive analysis on the test video and reviewing the results.\n",
       "7. **[Batch Processing Function](#batch-function):** Defining a function to apply the annotation process to multiple videos efficiently.\n",
       "8. **[Run Full Batch Processing (Optional)](#run-batch):** Executing the pipeline on a larger set of videos from your dataset.\n",
       "9. **[Conclusion](#conclusion):** Summarizing the process and suggesting next steps."
