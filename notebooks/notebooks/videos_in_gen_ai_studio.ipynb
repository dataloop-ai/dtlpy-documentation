    "# Videos in Dataloop GenAI Evaluation Studio Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook guides you through the process of setting up a Dataloop project and dataset for evaluating videos using the Dataloop GenAI Evaluation Studio. The GenAI Evaluation Studio provides a powerful interface for creating custom evaluation workflows, particularly useful for assessing video content quality, relevance, and other subjective metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll learn how to create evaluation layouts, upload videos, and set up comprehensive evaluation workflows that can be used by annotators to assess video content systematically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites:\n",
    "* **Dataloop Account:** You should have access to a Dataloop platform account.\n",
    "* **Python Environment:** Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed with pip.\n",
    "* **Project Access:** Ability to create projects and manage datasets.\n",
    "* **Local Files:** Access to the required configuration and video files as described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Required Local Files:\n",
    "* `data/layout.json`: A JSON file defining the structure and questions for the evaluation interface.\n",
    "* `data/item_schema.json`: A template JSON file that will link your video to the evaluation layout.\n",
    "* `data/videos/`: A directory containing the video files you want to upload and evaluate.\n",

    "- Connected to Dataloop and configured your project for video evaluation\n",
    "- Created or retrieved a dataset for storing videos and evaluation items\n",
    "- Understood the structure and components of evaluation layouts (`layout.json`)\n",
    "- Uploaded an evaluation layout that defines the UI for your annotators\n",
    "- Learned about the evaluation item schema and its role in linking videos to layouts\n",
    "- Processed and uploaded videos along with their corresponding evaluation JSON items\n",
    "- Set up the complete workflow for video evaluation in the GenAI Evaluation Studio\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Happened:\n",
    "1. Connected to Dataloop and your specified project.\n",
    "2. Created or retrieved a dataset for video evaluation.\n",
    "3. Uploaded an evaluation layout (`layout.json`) that defines the UI for your annotators.\n",
    "4. For each video in your `data/videos` directory:\n",
    "   - The video file was uploaded to the dataset.\n",
    "   - A corresponding JSON item was created and uploaded. This item links the video to the evaluation layout and tells Dataloop to open it with the Evaluation Studio.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "- **Navigate to your dataset in the Dataloop platform:** You should see the uploaded JSON items (e.g., `myvideo.json`). The video files themselves will be in a `/videos/` folder within the dataset's item browser.\n",
    "- **Open one of the JSON items:** Right click on the item → Open With and select \"GenAI Evaluation Studio\". It should open in the GenAI Evaluation Studio, displaying the video alongside the questions defined in your `layout.json`.\n",
    "- **Create annotation tasks:** You can now assign these evaluation items to annotators by creating tasks in Dataloop.\n",
    "- **Customize evaluation layouts:** Experiment with different component types and conditional logic to create more sophisticated evaluation workflows.\n",
    "- **Analyze evaluation results:** Use Dataloop's analytics and reporting features to analyze the evaluation responses and derive insights from your video assessments.\n",
    "- **Scale your workflow:** Integrate this process into larger content evaluation pipelines for systematic video quality assessment."
