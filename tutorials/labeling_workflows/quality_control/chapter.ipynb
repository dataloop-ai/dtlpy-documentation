    "   - Working on critical data\n",
    "   - Need high confidence in results\n",
    "   - Have complex annotation guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Use Honeypot Tasks When**:\n",
    "   - Managing large-scale operations\n",
    "   - Need ongoing quality monitoring\n",
    "   - Want unobtrusive quality checks\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use Qualification Tasks When**:\n",
    "   - Onboarding new annotators\n",
    "   - Starting a new project type\n",
    "   - Need to assess specific skills\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quality Control Tips \ud83c\udf1f\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **For Consensus Tasks**:\n",
    "   - Start with a small consensus percentage\n",
    "   - Increase based on disagreement rates\n",
    "   - Use for training and standardization\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **For Honeypot Tasks**:\n",
    "   - Rotate honeypot items regularly\n",
    "   - Keep honeypot items representative\n",
    "   - Monitor trends over time\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **For Qualification Tasks**:\n",
    "   - Include various difficulty levels\n",
    "   - Provide clear instructions\n",
    "   - Set realistic passing thresholds\n",
