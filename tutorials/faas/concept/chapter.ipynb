Altogether, FaaS serves as a super flexible unit that provides you with increased capabilities in the Dataloop platform and allows achieving any need while automating processes.  \n", "  \n", "With Dataloop FaaS, you simply upload your code and create your functions. Following that, you can define a time interval or specify a resource event for triggering the function. When a trigger event occurs, the FaaS platform launches and manages the compute resources, and executes the function.  \n", "  \n", "You can configure the compute settings according to your preferences (machine types, concurrency, timeout, etc.) or use the default settings.  \n", "  \n", "  \n", "  \n", "## Use Cases  \n", "  \n", "**Pre annotation processing**: Resize, video assembler, video dissembler  \n", "  \n", "**Post annotation processing**: Augmentation, crop box-annotations, auto-parenting  \n", "  \n", "**ML models**: Auto-detection  \n", "  \n", "**QA models**: Auto QA, consensus model, majority vote model  \n", "  \n"]}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"display_name": "Python 3", "language": "python", "name": "python3"}, "language_info": {"codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "file_extension": ".py", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "name": "python", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "version": "3.7.7"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 4}
