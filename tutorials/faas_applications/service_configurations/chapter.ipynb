    "### Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- Save time and resources by avoiding repeated setups.\n",
    "- Ensure consistency with the same version and configuration.\n",
    "- Simplify updates\u2014apply changes once, and all projects benefit.\n",
    "- Optimize costs by centralizing the service.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you install an application (e.g., Annotation Studio, Function App, Model), the system creates a service entry in CloudOps \u2192 Services. Sharing this service lets other projects access the same application without redeployment.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "To use an application from another project:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Same Organization** \u2013 The application\u2019s service must belong to the same organization as your current project.\n",
    "- **Service Bot Membership** \u2013 The application\u2019s service bot (from the original project) must be added as a member of your current project.\n",
    "- **User Access** \u2013 You must be a member of the original project where the application is hosted.\n",

    "\n",

    "- Always use secrets for sensitive information\n",
    "- Implement proper error handling\n",
    "- Regular audit of service configurations\n",
