# About Dataloop

The [Dataloop](https://dataloop.ai) platform allows you to manage unstructured data (pictures, video files, audio files, etc.) and annotate it using various annotation tools (box, polygon, classification etc). Annotation work is divided into tasks that include annotation and QA tasks.  QA tasks allow for quality assurance by raising issues and requesting fixes from the original annotator. Dataloop automations enable you to run your own or public code packages as services running on the Dataloop platform that can take advantage of various types of compute node including GPU backed compute nodes. To achieve any data-dependent business goal, Dataloop pipelines allow you to combine services (compute) with people (in tasks) and models (for example, pre-annotation).

## Platform vs Sotwared Development Kit (SDK)

There are 3 ways in which you can use Dataloop: online platform,[ API ](https://gate.dataloop.ai/api/v1/docs) or Python SDK (code).

This documentation and onboarding is focused on the Python code side (SDK) of our platform. It teaches you how to do everything using python code and basic python tools.

If you want to try our online platform, you can [use this documentation to get started](https://dataloop.ai/docs/welcome).

If you are interested in our API, you can [find out more here](https://dataloop.ai/docs/api).
