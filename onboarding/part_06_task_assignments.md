## Tasks & assignments

Annotation work in the Dataloop called [task](https://dataloop.ai/docs/tasks-assignments) that include main elements: 
data itself, team and instructions ( recipe & ontology).

You can [create tasks](../tutorials/task_workflows/create_a_task/chapter.md) from entire dataset or based on certain parameters by using filters.


***Exercise:***
1. Get a dataset
2. Filter out only not annotated items
3. Create an annotation task and assigned it to 2 different contributors
