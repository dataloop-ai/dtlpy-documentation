##Advanced tasks & assignments

Items in a task are distributed among all contributors. The automatic option will assign an equal portion of items per contributor, while the manual option gives you more control (some contributors are more experienced than others, and some may not be fully available to the assigned task).

While the task is actively worked by annotators you can choose to redistribute and balance again the remaining items between annotators

Because changes in the workforce can occur while the task is active, you have the option to reassign an assignment from one annotator to the other


Please follow [this](https://github.com/dataloop-ai/dtlpy-documentation/blob/main/tutorials/task_workflows/redistributing_and_reassigning_a_task/chapter.md) tutorial to learn how to reassign and redistribute assignments.
